# Bayesian Cognitive Modeling

**Course Project:** CGS698C – Bayesian Models & Data Analysis  
**Instructor:** Prof. Himanshu Yadav  
**Institute:** IIT Kanpur  
**Duration:** May 2025 – Present  

## 🧠 Objective
To model and analyze cognitive processes—particularly word recognition—using Bayesian statistical techniques and cognitive hypotheses. Core focus was on deriving posterior distributions, performing inference using simulation-based techniques, and evaluating lexical access hypotheses.

## 📄 Assignment Overview

### ✅ [Assignment 01: Bayesian Foundations](assignments/Assignment-01.pdf)
- Introduced probability, discrete & continuous variables
- Visualized likelihood functions for recognition time
- Built intuition around the difference between PDF and likelihood

### ✅ [Assignment 02: Posterior Estimation and Cognitive Hypotheses](assignments/Assignment-02.pdf)
- Posterior estimation from binomial & Gaussian data
- Prior vs posterior comparison for real-world data (e.g., reading times)
- Modeled Lexical-Access Hypothesis using hierarchical normal priors

### ✅ [Assignment 03: Simulation-Based Inference Techniques](assignments/Assignment-03.pdf)
- Posterior estimation via:
  - Grid approximation
  - Monte Carlo integration
  - Importance Sampling
  - Metropolis-Hastings MCMC
  - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)
- Hierarchical regression for RT data: `RT ~ α + β·type`
- Posterior sensitivity analysis and credible intervals

## 🔍 Highlighted Techniques
- ✅ **Grid Approximation**: Brute-force estimation of posterior density  
- ✅ **Importance Sampling**: Efficient resampling based on proposal distributions  
- ✅ **MCMC (Metropolis-Hastings)**: Random walk sampling using acceptance ratios  
- ✅ **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo**: Gradient-based exploration of posterior landscape  
- ✅ **Truncated Priors**: Constrained modeling of non-negative parameters (e.g., β > 0)  
- ✅ **Credible Intervals**: Bayesian analog to confidence intervals for parameters

## 📈 Outcomes

- Verified the **Lexical Access Hypothesis** by quantifying differences in word vs non-word recognition times using hierarchical models.
- Implemented and compared multiple **posterior estimation techniques** to validate theoretical assumptions.
- Visualized and analyzed **posterior sensitivities**, convergence of samplers, and prior influence.
